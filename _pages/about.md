### Welcome!
#### I am **Shoubhik Banerjee** a graduate student in the [Kao Lab](https://www.thekaolab.com/) at the University of Massachussetts Boston.
I am interested in understanding how collective animal groups like fish schools, bird flocks and ant colonies coordinate individual behaviors and decisions to function in unpredicatble environments. Specifically, I work on identifying the error correcting mechanisms that have evolved in collective groups to suppress the spread of false alarms.

To address these questions, I take an interdisciplinary approach combining mathematical models based on physical theories with high resolution remote sensing datasets collected during behavioral experiments.
